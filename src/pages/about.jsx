            Hi, I’m Izahan, a passionate Frontend Developer with a strong focus
            on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I
            enjoy turning ideas into real products using modern web
            technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            I specialize in React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS,
            and I have hands-on experience building real-world projects like
            admin dashboards, portfolio websites, and CRUD-based applications
            using APIs.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m currently looking for remote frontend opportunities where I can
            contribute, grow as a developer, and work on meaningful products.
